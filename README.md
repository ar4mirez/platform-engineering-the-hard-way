# Platform Engineering The Hard Way

In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn how to build a DevOps platform using Kubernetes and various CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) projects. The workshop is designed to take participants from the basics of deploying applications manually on Kubernetes to implementing automated deployments using ArgoCD. By the end of the workshop, participants should have a strong understanding of key DevOps practices and tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
