## Module 1: Introduction to Kubernetes and CNCF Projects

In this module, we will introduce you to the fundamentals of Kubernetes and provide an overview of CNCF projects that play a crucial role in modern DevOps practices.

### 1.1. Kubernetes Overview

#### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It simplifies the management of containers and allows for efficient resource utilization.

#### Key Kubernetes Concepts
- **Nodes:** These are the worker machines that run containers.
- **Pods:** The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, where containers run.
- **Services:** Provide network connectivity to pods.
- **Deployments:** Manage the lifecycle of pods and ensure a desired number are running.
- **ConfigMaps and Secrets:** Store configuration data securely.

### 1.2. CNCF Projects Overview

#### What is CNCF?
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an organization that hosts a wide range of open-source projects designed to enable cloud-native computing. We'll briefly introduce some key CNCF projects relevant to DevOps.

- **Helm:** A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment.
- **Tekton:** A Kubernetes-native framework for building CI/CD pipelines.
- **ArgoCD:** A GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.
- **Prometheus:** An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
- **Grafana:** A popular tool for creating dashboards and visualizing metrics.

### 1.3. Workshop Environment Setup

Before we dive into hands-on labs, let's set up our workshop environment.

#### Prerequisites
- **Kubernetes Cluster:** You can use a cloud provider like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, or set up Minikube for local development.
- **kubectl:** The Kubernetes command-line tool.
- **Docker:** To build container images (if required).
- **Helm:** The Helm package manager.
- **Git:** For version control and managing source code.

#### Verify Kubernetes Cluster
Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

You should see information about your cluster, such as the Kubernetes master's URL.

#### Verify kubectl
Check that `kubectl` is correctly configured to connect to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl version --short
```

This should display both the Client and Server versions.

#### Verify Helm Installation
Ensure Helm is installed by running:

```bash
helm version --short
```

You should see both the Client and Server versions of Helm.

### 1.4. Workshop Directory Structure

To keep things organized during the workshop, let's create a directory structure:

```bash
mkdir devops-workshop
cd devops-workshop
```

You can use this directory to store your configuration files, scripts, and other workshop-related resources.

### 1.5. Conclusion

In this module, we've introduced the basic concepts of Kubernetes and provided an overview of CNCF projects. We've also set up the workshop environment, ensuring that you have the necessary tools and a Kubernetes cluster to proceed.

In the following modules, we will dive deeper into various CNCF projects and demonstrate how to use them to build a DevOps platform with Kubernetes.
